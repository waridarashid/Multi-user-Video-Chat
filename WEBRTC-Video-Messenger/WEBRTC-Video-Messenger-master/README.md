Steps: (assuming node and jdk are installed in the computer)
1. clone the repo
2. open cmd inside NodeJSFiles
3. type in the command: npm test. This will start a dev dependency server. copy the address that appears on the command line
4. open and run WebRTCServerPeer [preferably with an IDE (i.e. netbeans or eclipse)]. This will start glashfish server
   that will be used for signalling purposes in the messenger.
5. when both the servers are up and running, open a web brower (crome, mozilla etc.) 
   and paste the address copied in step 3 inside the address bar.
